                    <span>As a dedicated Software Developer, I have gained
                        valuable
                        experience and skills since I began my career in 2016,
                        following the completion of my undergraduate degree. I
                        have
                        had the privilege of working with Tata Consultancy
                        Services
                        from 2016 to 2022, where I have consistently delivered
                        high-quality solutions that effectively meet the needs
                        of
                        clients and end-users alike.</span>
                    <span>My skillset is constantly evolving, and I make sure to
                        stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies
                        to ensure that my work is innovative and effective. I
                        believe in a collaborative approach to problem-solving
                        and enjoy working with my colleagues to find creative
                        solutions to complex challenges.</span>
                    <span>When I'm not working, I enjoy playing video games and
                        cooking. These hobbies not only provide a welcome break
                        from work but also help me to stay sharp and focused
                        when I'm on the job. I'm excited to continue learning
                        and growing in my career as a Software Developer and to
                        make meaningful contributions to the industry.</span>
